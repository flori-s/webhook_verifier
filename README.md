  allowed_drift_seconds: 300 # 5 minutes
)
```

## Usage

In your webhook controller:

```ruby
class WebhooksController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def receive
    payload = request.raw_post
    headers = request.headers

    verifier = WebhookVerifier.new(secret: ENV['WEBHOOK_SECRET'])

    unless verifier.valid?(payload, headers)
      head :unauthorized and return
    end

    # Process webhook data...

    head :ok
  end
end
```
